# DFRobot_BMV080
This BMV080 PM2.5 sensor module is designed to be compact, highly accurate, and has a wide measurement range. Its core is based on the latest BMV080 sensor element developed by Bosch - the world's smallest PM air quality sensor. Its size is over 450 times smaller than similar products on the market. Although the size has been revolutionarily reduced, its performance remains undiminished. It can not only accurately measure the mass concentration of PM2.5 particles in the air, but also support the detection of PM1 and PM10.<br>

Traditional PM2.5 sensors usually rely on fans or ducts to introduce freely floating particles into the detection area, thus being larger in size and accompanied by the noise from the fans and dust accumulation problems, which increase maintenance costs and the risk of failure. However, this sensor adopts a measurement principle similar to a camera, using laser optical technology, to calculate the mass concentration based on the counting and relative speed of particles in the free space. It ingeniously uses the natural airflow around to drive the particles into the detection area for direct measurement, without the need for fans or forced air flow systems, thus eliminating maintenance troubles and avoiding dust accumulation caused by fans, significantly improving the reliability of the equipment. <br>

## Summary

DFRobot_BMV080 is a arduino library designed to drive the new Bosch air quality measurement chip BMV080.                
BMV080 is currently the smallest PM2.5 chip in the world and it uses laser for measurement.                          
This library provides two communication methods: IIC and SPI, as well as some basic routines.Currently, it only supports the ESP32 platform.

## Installation

To use this library, first download the library file, paste it into the \Arduino\libraries directory, then open the examples folder and run the demo in the folder.


## Methods

```C++
  /**
   * @fn openBmv080
   * @brief Initialize the BMV080 sensor
   * @pre Must be called first in order to create the _handle_ required by other functions.
   * @post The _handle_ must be destroyed via _bmv080_close_.
   * @note It must be called before any other functions that interact with the sensor.
   * @return int: Returns ERR_OK if successful, otherwise returns an error code.
   */
  uint8_t openBmv080(void);

  /**
   * @fn closeBmv080
   * @brief Close the sensor unit.
   * @pre Must be called last in order to destroy the _handle_ created by _bmv080_open_.
   * @return bool: Returns true if successful, otherwise returns false.
   */
  bool closeBmv080(void);

  /**
   * @fn resetBmv080
   * @brief Reset a sensor unit including both hardware and software.
   * @pre A valid _handle_ generated by _bmv080_open_ is required. 
   * @post Any parameter changed through _bmv080_set_parameter_ is reverted back to its default.
   * @return bool: Returns true if successful, otherwise returns false.
   */
  bool resetBmv080(void);

  /**
   * @fn getBmv080DV
   * @brief Get the BMV080 sensor's driver version
   * @param major: Major version number
   * @param minor: Minor version number
   * @param patch: Patch version number
   * @return bool: Returns true if successful, otherwise returns false.
   */
  bool getBmv080DV(uint16_t &major, uint16_t &minor, uint16_t &patch);

  /**
   * @fn getBmv080ID
   * @brief Get the version information of this sensor driver.
   * @param id: Unique ID
   * @return bool: Returns true if successful, otherwise returns false.
   */
  bool getBmv080ID(char *id);

  /**
   * @fn getBmv080Data
   * @brief Get the BMV080 sensor's data
   * @param PM1: PM1.0 concentration
   * @param PM2_5: PM2.5 concentration
   * @param PM10: PM10 concentration
   * @note This function should be called at least once every 1 second.
   * @return 1 successful, when the BMV080 sensor data is ready.
   * @return 0 unsuccessful, when the BMV080 sensor data is not ready.
   */
  bool getBmv080Data(float *PM1, float *PM2_5, float *PM10);

  /**
   * @fn get_bmv080Data
   * @brief Assign the data of BMV080 to the variable bmv080_output_t.
   * @param bmv080_output: Output structure containing the BMV080 sensor data
   * @note This fuction is called in the callback function getBmv080Data_cb.
   * @return bool: Returns true if successful, otherwise returns false.
   */
  bool get_bmv080Data(bmv080_output_t bmv080_output);

  /**
   * @fn setBmv080Mode
   * @brief Set the BMV080 sensor's mode.
   * @param mode: The mode to set, either DFRobot_BMV080_MODE_CONTINUOUS or DFRobot_BMV080_MODE_DUTY_CYCLE
   *              DFRobot_BMV080_MODE_CONTINUOUS: Sensor takes measurements continuously
   *              DFRobot_BMV080_MODE_DUTY_CYCLE: Sensor takes measurements at specified intervals
   * @return 1 successful
   * @return 0 error

## Change the SDK
If you want to upgrade the Bosch BMV080 SDK, you can follow the steps below.<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Since Bosch currently only provides the pre-compiled library of BMV080, it can only support the platforms that are supported by the Bosch library. The SDK used for this update is from Bosch. You can download and update it from their official website. [Click here to jump to the next page](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/particulate-matter-sensor/bmv080/#documents).<br>
> This library has reserved the SDK of version Bosch bmv080-sdk-v11-1-0. You can directly use it or replace it with the latest SDK of your own choice.The replace method will be visible to you later.

### Install the SDK
You can download the SDK from Bosch official website. [Click here to jump to the next page](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/particulate-matter-sensor/bmv080/#documents).<br>
